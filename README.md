## Technologies


This was run on a pc using Windows 10

This project leverages python 3.8.8 with the following packages:


* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs) - For manipulating the DataFrame.

* [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io.en/stable) - For code and visualizations.

* [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - For scientific computing with python.

* [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - For location through the directory and file path.

* [balance_accuracy_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score.html) - For computing the balanced accuracy.

* [confusion_matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html) - For computing the confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification.

* [classification_report_imbalanced](http://glemaitre.github.io/imbalanced-learn/generated/imblearn.metrics.classification_report_imbalanced.html) - For building a classification report based on metrics used with an imbalanced dataset.

## Examples

The images below show the different types of charts and graphs that should be a result from running the code in the Forecasting Net Prophet application. By reviewing the charts and graphs we can produce a sales forecast to the finance division with the expected total sales for next quarter.
